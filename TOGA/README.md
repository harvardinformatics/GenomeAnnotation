# TOGA: exon-aware liftover
In cases where there is a reasonably high-quality annotation for a species closely related to the genome you wish to annotate, transferring or "lifting over" gene models from that high quality annotation may be a useful approach. Such methods begin with a whole-genome alignment, which serves as the basis of mapping the genomic coordinates of the source annotation to analogous coordinates in the target genome, i.e. the one you wish to annotate. We evaluate [TOGA](https://github.com/hillerlab/TOGA), a liftover approach that is exon-aware, and is able to classify genes in the target species as orthologs, paralogs or processed pseudogenes.
