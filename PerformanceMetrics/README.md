# Annotation Quality Metrics
We employ a diverse suite of metrics to evaluate the quality of gene predictions produced by the evaluated tools and pipelines. Below, we summarize those metrics and indicate how to generate them.

* **Transcriptome BUSCO score**. For a set of predicted transcripts, we assess the fraction of conserved single-copy orthologs (i.e. BUSCOs) with the software [BUSCO](https://busco.ezlab.org/), using appropriate taxonomic databases for each organismal group (e.g. arthropods for the *Drosophila* species. BUSCO score is computed as 1-(missing BUSCOs/number of BUSCO targets in database). Because this score can be constrained by the quality and completeness of the genome assembly for which gene predictions are made, to look for general patterns across species we evalute the **BUSCO score ratio**, which is simply the ratio of the BUSCO score obtained for the set of predicted transcripts to that obtained for the genome. Example slurm scripts for running BUSCO in transcriptome and genome mode are in the slurm_cripts directory.
