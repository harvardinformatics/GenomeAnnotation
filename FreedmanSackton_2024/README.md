# Building better genome annotations across the tree of life
This directory contains scripts, data tables, and code for executing genome annotation methods, and for generating figures found in the resulting manuscript [Freedman and Sackton, 2024)[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.12.589245v2]. Those interested in implementing the top-peforming methods in their own work should look for descriptions of best practice for BRAKER, TOGA, and Stringtie in relevant subdirectories one level above this directory. In the near future, these directories will point to separate repositiories containing snakemake workflow for implementing those analysses.
