# Genome annotation
This repository has two main goals:

* To provide analysis details, job submission scripts, and R code for producing figures for our manuscript summarizing our comprehensive performance evaluation of several genome annotation methods across 21 species. This manuscript can be found on **bioRxiv**, as  [*Building better genome annotations across the tree of life*](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.12.589245v1.full).
* To provide detailed descriptions concerning how to run those genome annotation tools that, based upon our findings, have the potential to produce good annotations for at least some species.

Fully automated workflows for running these tools, including pre-processing of input data and filtering of annotations outputs, will be developed in separate repositories that are currently under development.
